# GECO summer of code

The GECO summer of code mirrors Google's summer of code by highlighting small research projects of lab members. These are volunteray contributions of small (side) projects taught to other lab members and documented for the public, providing a source of teaching material and spurring on novel ideas. Most of the content you find here will be featured on the GECO website in the form of blog posts (but without code / data).

## Contributing

Contributions are invited! Add a directory with materials into this directory to add your presentation / code / notebook. Projects are free form, but an introduction would be appreciated if the
repository is visited afterwards.
